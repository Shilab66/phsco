        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            The contest will contain <span className="text-gold-400 font-bold">15-20 programming problems</span> to solve in
            <span className="text-gold-400 font-bold"> 4 hours</span>. Each problem will present a unique task, and your team 
            will need to design and implement a code algorithm to solve the problem. Sample inputs and outputs are provided 
            for each problem to assist with debugging. Solution programs can be written in C++, Java, or Python.
            If you want to use another language that is not listed here, fill out a support form.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="text-gold-400 font-bold">Only a select few problems will be available at the start of the contest. 
            More problems will be revealed as your team completes problems and submits correct solutions.</span> Each problem is
            weighted equally, but note that some problems effectively become more "valuable" by locking further progression in the contest
            behind their completion. A diagram of all problems in the contest and how to unlock their statements will be given
            early on in the competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you submit a program on Codeforces, it will automatically be run against a number of test cases, which must all be passed
            to receive credit. No information on the status of hidden test cases will be provided besides
            whether your solution passes or fails them. <span className="text-gold-400 font-bold">If you pass all test cases offered by a problem,
            clicking on your submission details will show checker feedback and reveal any access codes attached to the problem.</span> If
            you need to view this information again, you can simply view your submission history; resubmission is not needed and will penalize you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Final standings will be calculated using an <span className="text-gold-400 font-bold">ICPC-style leaderboard</span>, with a 20-minute penalty for incorrect submissions (including resubmission after a correct answer).
            Rankings are based on the number of problems solved, with ties broken by the team's total time penalty (sum of elapsed times until first correct submission per problem, plus penalties for incorrect submissions).
            No time penalty is applied to unsolved problems. The leaderboard will be <span className="text-gold-400 font-bold">frozen 1 hour prior</span> to the end of the contest.
          </p>
          <p>
            All problem statements are intended to be straightforward, with no intentional "hidden tricks". If you have a question
            regarding the wording of a problem during the competition, fill out a support form and the organizers will respond
            as quickly as possible (note, however, that you may not get more than a "read carefully" response). In the event that
            a problem statement needs correction, all competitors will be notified via an email, a Discord announcement, and through
            the Codeforces notification system.

            <li>Do not use pre-written code or "templates" to get a head start on your coding. This is at the discretion of the judges; pre-written library imports and shorthand definitions are fine, while a pre-written DFS function is not.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gold-400 mb-2">What division should I join?</h3>
            <p>
              Try to join the division where you will learn the most! If you are taking courses like APCSA or APCSP, or this
              is your first-ever programming competition, the Standard Division is a great introduction to competitive programming.
              If you are very comfortable with programming (i.e. FRC, game dev, outside projects) and/or have competition experience (ACSL Senior, USACO Silver+),
              the Advanced Division is probably more suitable for you.

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gold-400 mb-2">What resources can I use?</h3>
            <p>
              You are allowed to consult reference books and materials, such as language documentation and websites like w3schools.
              However, any code you submit must be written by your team. Pasting large code snippets from online sources is disallowed.
              You cannot use pre-written code or "templates" to get a head start on your coding (refer to the contest rules for more details).
              Additionally, you are not allowed to consult online forums such as StackOverflow and/or post questions regarding the competition while it is running.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gold-400 mb-2">Is AI allowed?</h3>
            <p>
              <span className="text-gold-400 font-bold">No.</span> Using an AI during a programming competition is no different than 
              using a chess engine during an online chess tournament - it's morally wrong, you won't learn anything, and it ruins the
              fun for everyone. Any suspected use of AI will lead to immediate disqualification and potentially being blacklisted from future events.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gold-400 mb-2">What programming languages/libraries are supported?</h3>
            <p>
              All problems are tested with C++, Java, and Python solutions. Only inbuilt libraries are supported; i.e. math for Python and bits/stdcpp.h for C++.
